## Introduction

Mango Leaf Disease Prediction is a project that uses a trained machine learning model to classify diseases in mango leaves based on input images. The project consists of two main components: the ipynb for training and the streamlit web app.

## Web Application

The web application allows users to upload an image of a mango leaf, and it provides real-time predictions for the disease type. It uses a Flask backend for image processing and prediction.

### Web Application Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pypi-ahmad/mango-leaf-disease-prediction.git
cd mango-leaf-disease-prediction
```

2. Install the required Python packages (you may want to use a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.
